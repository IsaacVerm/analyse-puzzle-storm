# Analyse Puzzle Storm

Data collected by [my Puzzle Storm extension](https://github.com/IsaacVerm/puzzle-storm-extension) is saved in the [track-puzzle-storm repository](https://github.com/IsaacVerm/track-puzzle-storm). 
I use Vega Lite to create a dashboard for the Puzzle Storm data. I just need to point `dashboard.html` to the data in the repo. There's no need to download anything or have a server running to render the dashboard.
I used [this template](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/usage/embed.html) to get the dashboard started.
